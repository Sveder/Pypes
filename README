Entry in PyWeek #5  <http://www.pyweek.org/5/>
Team: Pypes
Members: ME (= Mikle :))


DEPENDENCIES:

You might need to install some of these before running the game:

  Python (2.5 recommended):     			http://www.python.org/
  PyGame:     								http://www.pygame.org/
  libtiff.dll (usually comes with SDL): 	http://www.libtiff.org/


RUNNING THE GAME:
On Windows or Mac OS X, locate the "run_game.py" file and double-click it.
Othewise open a terminal / console and "cd" to the game directory and run:

  python run_game.py



HOW TO PLAY THE GAME:

The game's goal is to make a path between your computer (with a blue keyboard!)
to the game server (Icon of the game whose level you are on). You do that by
manually routing the traffic using some parts you found lying around - TWISTED
cable pairs. 
When you win or lose you'll get an appropriate response and you'll got to the next level.

Notice each level has a theme about a specific game, and especially the Diablo level
is cool. The themes are randomized.
Sometimes you'll get bonuses - like the bonus you'll get for each TWIST in 
the path you built or the mysterious "time" bonus.

CONTROLS:

Click on places you want to put the current (first on the side) brick in.
- +			Decrese or increase the time you have left for the level by 5 seconds.
alt + f4 	Quit
